NAME

    OpenTelemetry - support for https://opentelemetry.io application
    tracing

DESCRIPTION

    OpenTelemetry is due to become the successor to the OpenTracing
    initiative. It includes additional functionality relating to metrics,
    and at the time of writing is an evolving specification.

    Current status of the official spec can be tracked here:

    https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/README.md

    Note that the https://opentracing.io specification is currently more
    widely supported, but eventually OpenTracing::Any and
    OpenTelemetry::Any should be able to coÃ«xist in a codebase and support
    collectors for either system.

    For metrics, see Metrics::Any.

 Tools and specifications

      * https://opentelemtry.io - the new standard

      * https://opentracing.io - if you want something that works today

 Other modules

    Some perl modules of relevance:

      * OpenTracing::Manual - this is an independent Moo-based
      implementation, probably worth a look if you're working mostly with
      synchronous code.

      * NewRelic::Agent - support for NewRelic's APM system
