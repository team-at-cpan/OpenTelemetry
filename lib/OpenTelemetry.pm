=head1 NAME

OpenTelemetry - support for L<https://opentelemetry.io> application tracing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

OpenTelemetry is due to become the successor to the OpenTracing initiative.
It includes additional functionality relating to metrics,
and at the time of writing is an evolving specification.

Current status of the official spec can be tracked here:

L<https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/README.md>

Note that the L<https://opentracing.io> specification is currently more widely supported,
but eventually L<OpenTracing::Any> and L<OpenTelemetry::Any>
should be able to coÃ«xist in a codebase and support collectors
for either system.

For metrics, see L<Metrics::Any>.

=item * L<OpenTracing::Manual> - this is an independent Moo-based implementation, probably worth a look
if you're working mostly with synchronous code.
